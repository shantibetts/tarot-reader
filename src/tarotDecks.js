		description: `The best known Tarot deck is the Rider-Waite-Smith deck. There are
	hundreds of others, but the images of the RWS Tarot are the ones which
	are instantly recognizable. Holly Voley has graciously scanned a set
	of vintage Tarot cards for sacred-texts.com, the earliest in her
	collection. These Tarot card images are unambiguously in the public
	domain in the United States, and differ only slightly from the US
	Games Tarot deck. This deck is the one known as the 'Pamela-A' deck
	with the dried mud pattern on the back of the cards.`,
